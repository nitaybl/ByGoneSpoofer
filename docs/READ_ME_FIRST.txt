Hey there! 👋

Welcome to ByGone Spoofer. I know there's a LOT of documentation (15+ files!),
so let me help you figure out what to read.

==============================================================================
                        🚀 I'M IN A HURRY! QUICK START:
==============================================================================

Want to get started RIGHT NOW? Read these 3 files in order:

1. README.md (skim the features section)
   → Understand what this tool does

2. ROBLOX_2025_GUIDE.md (read the strategy section)
   → Learn how to avoid detection

3. QUICK_START_GUI.txt or START_HERE.txt
   → How to actually run the spoofer

That's it! You can start spoofing after reading those 3.
Time needed: ~15 minutes

==============================================================================
                        🎯 BY YOUR SITUATION:
==============================================================================

├─ Learn which mode to use
├─ Read the 7-day protocol
└─ Bookmark success strategies

STEP 3: Follow Quick Start
├─ Get spoofer running
├─ Follow exact steps
└─ Test with Recommended mode first

STEP 4: Come back as needed
├─ Troubleshooting? → README.md troubleshooting
├─ Compilation? → Compilation guides
├─ Confused? → INDEX.md
└─ Need help? → Discord

==============================================================================
                        📣 FINAL WORDS:
==============================================================================

I know this is a LOT of documentation. But here's why that's GOOD:

✅ Everything is explained
✅ No guessing needed
✅ Troubleshooting is covered
✅ Success strategies included
✅ You have all the information

Most people only need to read 3-4 files (15-30 minutes).
The rest is reference material for when you need it.

Start with README.md, then ROBLOX_2025_GUIDE.md, then a quick start.
That's all you really need!

Good luck! 🍀
